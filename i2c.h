  mybook4's I2C bit banging library for the Digispark Pro
  Only supports writing at the moment
  Developed specifically to write register values to the GBS 8220
  Timing is based on the timing observed with the GBS 8220's onboard microcontroller

  This is (somewhat) based off of the TinyWireM and USI_TWI_Master interface
