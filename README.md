# RetroMatic2000

The "RetroMatic 2000" is a box I made (in part for the [Retro Challenge](http://www.retrochallenge.org/) in April 2017) to allow me to use my collection of 1980s computers with more modern accessories.

It comprises:

* a HD9800 RGB->VGA convertor board (a clone of the GBS8200)
* a scanline generator
* a Gotek floppy drive emulator (flashed with HxC firmware) with extra LCD display
* an Arduino to reprogram the HD9800 to accept 288p (non-interlaced) input
* an LCD and rotary encoder to control the Arduino and scanline generator via menus
* an additional rotary encoder to control the Gotek hardware (via the Arduino)

At the time of writing it is mostly finished, but the software is still a work in progress.  In particular the menus for controlling the scanline generator, and different modes on the HD9800, are incomplete.

The reprogramming of the TV5725 chip on the HD9800 is based on code from [mybook4/GBS_Control](https://github.com/mybook4/DigisparkSketches/tree/master/GBS_Control), which I believe was itself based on [dooklink/gbs-control](https://github.com/dooklink/gbs-control).

I haven't got full instructions for how to build one, but I documented the build extensively on my blog.  There should be enough information there (including circuit diagrams and board layouts) to follow along and build something similar.

__N.B. I found mistakes in my circuits as I went along and updated the diagrams in later blog posts.  Look for the circuit diagrams in the last few posts for the correct diagrams!!!__
